Just an attempt to help the students starting out, with some basic data structures and algorithm programs.(written in Java).
Please feel free to comment if you would like me to help you out in case you are struck or you have a better approach in solving them. I have tried to include all the way that I can think - from varying space and time complexities. So hold your horses if you think it can be done in linear time instead of quadratic. Cause may be, just maybe , I may have included that too :)
 So have a look, Happy coding. :)
